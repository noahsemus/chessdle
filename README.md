# Chessdle ‚ôüÔ∏è

A Wordle-inspired daily chess puzzle game using the Lichess Daily Puzzle API.

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by me!

Inspired by a story from GM Daniel Naroditsky _(Danya)_, where his teacher had him only say the **final move** of the puzzle, forcing him to calculate the full line.

## How it Works

Chessdle presents you with the Lichess Puzzle of the Day. Your goal is to figure out the **entire sequence of moves** that solves the puzzle.

1.  **Daily Puzzle:** The app fetches the current Puzzle of the Day from Lichess when loaded.
2.  **Input Moves:** You interact with the chessboard by dragging and dropping pieces to input the _full sequence_ of moves required to solve the puzzle.
3.  **Submit Attempt:** Once you have entered the complete sequence for an attempt, click the "Submit Attempt" button.
4.  **Get Feedback:** The app compares your submitted sequence to the actual solution, move by move, and provides feedback for each move in your sequence:
    - üü© **Green:** Correct move! You moved the correct piece (from the correct starting square) to the correct destination square for that step in the sequence.
    - üü® **Yellow:** Partially correct! EITHER you moved the correct piece (from the correct starting square) but to the wrong destination, OR you moved a different piece but landed on the correct destination square for that step.
    - üü• **Red:** Incorrect. Neither the piece's starting square nor the destination square matches the correct solution move for that step.
5.  **Guessing:** You have a limited number of attempts (currently set to 5) to guess the entire sequence correctly.
6.  **Win/Loss:**
    - You win if all moves in your submitted sequence are Green!
    - You lose if you run out of attempts. The correct solution will be shown.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Styling:** styled-components
- **Chess Logic:** `chess.js` (for validating moves, handling FEN/PGN, managing board state)
- **Chessboard UI:** `react-chessboard` (for displaying the board and handling drag-and-drop)
- **Puzzle Data:** Lichess API (`https://lichess.org/api/puzzle/daily`) via a CORS proxy (`https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=`)
